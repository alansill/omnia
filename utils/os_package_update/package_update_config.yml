# This variable accepts the path along with filename of the package list file
# The packages mentioned in this file will be installed/updated on the cluster
# The packages should be .rpm files only
# Other file types are not supported
# For OS packagelist, file name should be xxx.pkglist, where xxx is the custom name
# Eg: package_list: "/install/post/ospkgs.pkglist"
# For packages other than OS Packages, file name should be - xxx.otherpkgs.pkglist, where xxx is the custom name
# For other packages all rpms should be downloaded in the directory created "/install/post/otherpkgs/<os_type.os_version>/x86_64/custom_software/Packages/"
# "custom_software/" prefix should be added before all package names
# Eg: package_list: "/install/post/upgradepkgs.otherpkgs.pkglist"
# Default: /install/post/otherpkgs/rhels8.6.0/x86_64/custom_software/update.otherpkgs.pkglist
package_list: "/install/post/otherpkgs/rhels8.6.0/x86_64/custom_software/update.otherpkgs.pkglist"

# This variable accepts type of package that must be installed/updated on remote nodes
# This value can be "os" or "other"
# package_type: "os" - If packages to be installed/updated are os packages which are available in appstream or baseos

# This variable will contain list of all nodes on which packages must installed/updated
# If node list is not provided, all nodes provisioned by Omnia will be updated with the package list 
# Node name can be fetched from postgres DB, nodeinfo table
# By default packages will be installed/updated on all nodes
# Eg: nodelist: "node1,node2,node3,node4" or nodelist: "node1-node5"
# Default: all
nodelist: "all"

# This boolean variable determines if remote nodes are required to be rebooted
# If true then all node in node_list will get rebooted
# Default: false
reboot_required: false
